## Notes for Development

1. **AI Integration Priority**: Focus on getting one complete pipeline working (research → script → video) before adding features
2. **Cost Management**: Implement usage tracking early to monitor API costs
3. **User Experience**: Keep the UI simple during initial development
4. **Testing**: Add tests for critical paths (auth, project creation, AI pipeline)
5. **Security**: Never expose API keys in frontend code
